## 🎮 About the Game

![game screenshot](assets/Game_Screenshot.png)

I recently discovered a game called [**The Farmer Was Replaced**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160/The_Farmer_Was_Replaced/), and I think it’s one of the most fun and accessible ways to start learning programming.

In this game, you control a **drone** managing a **grid-based farm** — planting, watering, harvesting, trading, and unlocking new technologies, all through the code you write.

The entire game runs on **scripts you write**, making it a playful yet powerful introduction to programming logic.

Here’s what makes it special for learning Python:

* **Script-based automation:**
  You can code basic actions like `move()`, `plant()`, `harvest()`, or `use_item()`.
  The game supports `for` / `while` loops, conditionals, and functions (`def`), mirroring Python’s core syntax.

* **Varied crop mechanics:**
  Different plants (like carrots, pumpkins, sunflowers, or trees) follow unique growth or harvest rules.
  For example:

  * Sunflowers require a specific picking order.
  * Pumpkins merge into “mega-pumpkins” when clustered.
  * Cacti grow irregularly and may require sorting or pattern recognition.

* **Tech unlocks and progression:**
  As you automate and earn more, you can unlock features such as:

  * `Multi_Trade` – batch trading logic
  * `Debug` – code inspection tools
  * `Mazes` – pathfinding and algorithmic puzzles

Ultimately, your goal is to **design a self-sustaining farm** — where your drone operates efficiently with minimal intervention, guided by your strategy and logic.

## 💡 What Is This Project?

This repository is both a **learning journal** and a **toolbox**.
It contains:

* 🧠 **Articles:** short essays that explore how concepts like loops, conditionals, or A* pathfinding appear naturally in the game.
* 🧰 **Code Snippets:** reusable scripts and algorithm tips to make your farm smarter and your automation smoother.
* 🗺️ **Visuals & Notes:** diagrams showing field layouts, data structures, and tech tree logic.
