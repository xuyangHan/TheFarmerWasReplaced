# üå± Solving Maze and Dinosaur in *The Farmer Was Replaced*

## Recap

If you‚Äôve been following along, you already know that [**The Farmer Was Replaced**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160/The_Farmer_Was_Replaced/) isn‚Äôt just a cozy farming simulator ‚Äî it‚Äôs a visual sandbox for **learning automation and programming logic**.

So far, we‚Äôve written scripts that let our drone plant crops efficiently ‚Äî arranging trees, cactus, and pumpkins in smart, algorithmic patterns to maximize yield.

In this post, we‚Äôll move beyond farming and explore new puzzles that push our logical thinking even further ‚Äî starting with the **Dinosaur Hat challenge**, and later venturing into **maze solving**.

## ü¶ñ Dinosaur Mode

In this puzzle, you can equip the **Dinosaur Hat** to transform into a dinosaur with a growing tail:

```python
change_hat(Hats.Dinosaur_Hat)
```

Your goal? Eat the randomly spawned **apple** on the farm.

Just like in the classic **Snake** game, each apple you eat makes your tail grow longer ‚Äî and speeds up your movement. The rule is simple but unforgiving:
üëâ **You can‚Äôt collide with your own tail.**

The longer your tail grows, the higher your score ‚Äî or in this case, the more rewards you earn:

> Each full round gives you *n¬≤ √ó Items.Bone* at harvest.

### üß© The Idea: A Safe, Predefined Path

When you first encounter this challenge, a simple but powerful idea might come to mind:

> Instead of chasing the apple directly, what if the dinosaur always follows a **pre-defined safe route** that covers the entire farm?

That‚Äôs exactly the concept behind a **[Hamiltonian path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path)** ‚Äî a path that visits every tile on a grid exactly once.

In our case, we don‚Äôt need to compute such a path dynamically (which is a hard algorithmic problem).
We can design one manually ‚Äî a repeating, snake-like traversal pattern that guarantees full coverage.

### üß† Designing the Traversal Pattern

Let‚Äôs make this concrete by setting a manageable grid size:

```python
set_world_size(8)
```

A full traversal of a large 32√ó32 field could take over 30 minutes ‚Äî so an 8√ó8 grid makes experimentation much faster. (Though yes, a full 32√ó32 sweep can yield *millions of bones* if you‚Äôre patient!)

Here‚Äôs the plan for our route:

* The dinosaur moves **column by column**, alternating directions.
* **Even-numbered columns** (0, 2, 4, ‚Ä¶) go all the way **up to the top**.
* **Odd-numbered columns** (1, 3, 5, ‚Ä¶) come **down to the bottom ‚àí 1**, leaving the very bottom row free, making that open bottom row acts as a **return path** to the origin (0, 0).
* When you reach the rightmost edge, move along the bottom back home.

This creates a **looping, Hamiltonian-style route** that never crosses itself ‚Äî a perfect safety net for our growing dinosaur.

### üßæ Code Outline

```python
import navigation

clear()

change_hat(Hats.Dinosaur_Hat)
n = get_world_size()

while True:
	for x in range(n):
		# decide vertical target for this column
		if x % 2 == 0:
			target_y = n - 1   # even column index: go to the very top
		else:
			target_y = 1       # odd column index: go down but leave row 0 free
	
		# move vertically until we reach target_y
		while get_pos_y() != target_y:
			if target_y > get_pos_y():
				navigation.dinosaur_safe_move(North)
			else:
				navigation.dinosaur_safe_move(South)
	
		# after finishing the column, move east if there are more columns
		if x < n - 1:
			move(East)
	
	# finished scanning all columns
	# return to origin using the open bottom row y=0
	# first move down to y=0 (if not already there)
	while get_pos_y() != 0:
		navigation.dinosaur_safe_move(South)
	
	# then move west back to x=0
	while get_pos_x() != 0:
		navigation.dinosaur_safe_move(West)
	
	# now at (0,0)
```

``` python
# navigation.py
def dinosaur_safe_move(direction):
	# Move in the given direction if possible.
	# If movement is blocked, temporarily change hats as a workaround.
	
	if can_move(direction):
		move(direction)
	else:
		change_hat(Hats.Carrot_Hat)
		change_hat(Hats.Dinosaur_Hat)
```

This deterministic route ensures the dinosaur always has a valid move, regardless of where apples spawn.

### üîç Next Steps

This strategy is reliable but not optimal ‚Äî especially on larger farms.
Possible improvements include:

* **Adaptive pathing:** Instead of always traversing the entire field, detect where the next apple will spawn and shorten the path dynamically.
* **Early turns:** If you can confirm there‚Äôs a clear path back home, you can allow the dinosaur to ‚Äúcut corners‚Äù safely.

We‚Äôll revisit these optimizations later. For now, enjoy watching your pixelated reptile devour apples, grow endlessly, and harvest a *mountain of bones*. ü¶¥

## üß™ Maze Prep

Before we dive into solving the **maze puzzle**, let‚Äôs cover a few essential preparations ‚Äî specifically, how to **unlock the maze** and gather the materials required for it.

### 1. Unlocking the Maze: The Role of *Weird Substance*

To generate a maze, you‚Äôll need a special material called **Weird_Substance**, which can be crafted indirectly through **Fertilizer**.

Here‚Äôs how the game describes it:

> ‚ÄúFertilizer can make plants grow instantly.
> `use_item(Items.Fertilizer)` reduces the remaining growing time of the plant under the drone by 2 seconds.
> This has some side effects ‚Äî plants grown with fertilizer will be *infected*.
> When an infected plant is harvested, half of its yield turns into `Items.Weird_Substance`.‚Äù

In other words:

* **Fertilizer** accelerates plant growth,
* but **infects** the plant,
* producing **Weird_Substance** upon harvest.

That‚Äôs a key resource for unlocking **Mazes**, so we‚Äôll automate its generation next.

### 2. Automating *Weird_Substance* Production

Here‚Äôs a simple farming loop that continuously grows and harvests **Trees** ‚Äî using fertilizer each time to guarantee infection and Weird_Substance yield:

```python
while True:
    navigation.goto_naive(0, 0)
    harvest()
    use_item(Items.Water)
    plant(Entities.Tree)
    use_item(Items.Fertilizer)
```

This alone already provides a reliable supply.
But we can go a step further and **boost efficiency** with another mechanic you‚Äôve likely unlocked by now.

### 3. Boosting Yield with *Polyculture*

Once the **Polyculture** upgrade is available, plants will yield **extra resources when planted alongside compatible crops**.

You can find which plants go well together using:

```python
plant_type, (x, y) = get_companion()
```

This built-in function tells you:

* what type of **companion crop** to plant (`plant_type`), and
* at which **grid position** (`x, y`) it should go.

Companion preferences are usually one of:
`Entities.Grass`, `Entities.Bush`, `Entities.Tree`, or `Entities.Carrot`.

This mechanic synergizes perfectly with our Weird_Substance loop ‚Äî giving you both *extra resources* and *faster regeneration*.

### 4. Putting It All Together

We‚Äôll use a **small 3√ó3 or 5√ó5 farm** for quick cycling and efficiency.
Here‚Äôs the plan:

1. At **(0, 0)** ‚Äî grow a Tree with Fertilizer (to trigger Weird_Substance generation).
2. After planting, call `get_companion()` to locate and plant the companion crop.
3. Visit that location, harvest any existing crop, and plant the new one.
4. Return to (0, 0) to harvest and repeat.

Here‚Äôs the full working loop:

```python
import navigation
import farm_utils

clear()
set_world_size(5)
farm_utils.till_all()

while True:
    navigation.goto_naive(0, 0)
    harvest()
    use_item(Items.Water)
    plant(Entities.Tree)
    use_item(Items.Fertilizer)
    
    pl, (x, y) = get_companion()
    navigation.goto_naive(x, y)
    harvest()
    plant(pl)
```

### 5. Why This Works

This setup forms a **micro feedback loop** ‚Äî one of the core automation concepts in *The Farmer Was Replaced*.

* You grow ‚Üí harvest ‚Üí replant automatically.
* Each cycle yields both **crops** and **Weird_Substance**.
* The companion mechanic ensures **higher overall yield per cycle**.

In short: you‚Äôre turning a few lines of code into a **self-sustaining farm machine** that generates a lot Weird_Substance!
